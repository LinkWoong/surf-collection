## What is SURF?

From [offical website](http://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/research/summer-undergraduate-research-fellowships)

> The Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships (SURF) programme offers undergraduate students the chance to work on research projects in collaboration with academic supervisors, during the summer holidays.

## What is in this repository?

This repo offers a curated list of past surf projects. We want students to learn how to join in a research project and provide a platform for students to present their surf project. 

## How do I particiapte?

There are many ways, here we list some common ones:

* Wait until this year's SURF project list published, find interestd ones and contact the corresponding teacher.
* Have your own research project, contact teacher with expertise in the field
* Do not know what to do for surf but want to cooperate with specific teacher, contact the teacher directly

## I am not a XJTLU student, but I found a project interesting, how do I apply?

The university also supports non-XJTLU student to apply. Read more on [offical webpage](http://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/research/summer-undergraduate-research-fellowships)
